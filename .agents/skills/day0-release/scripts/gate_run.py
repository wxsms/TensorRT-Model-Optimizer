"""Day-0 evaluation-run gate.

Validates that a completed evaluation run is trustworthy before its scores are
compared. Mirrors the checks in evaluation/references/run-validation.md. Pure
decision logic in ``evaluate_run`` (unit-tested without a cluster); ``main``
reads a run-summary JSON and prints the verdict.

The run summary is a dict with, per task:
    {
      "tasks": {
        "<task>": {
          "status": "SUCCESS" | "FAILED" | "RUNNING" | "PENDING" | "TIMEOUT" | "RESUMING",
          "expected_samples": int,
          "scored_samples": int,
          "score": float | null,          # canonical score, if extracted
          "errors": [str, ...]            # judge/parse/sample errors, if any
        }
      }
    }
Only a terminal SUCCESS with complete, numeric scores passes. Non-terminal
statuses (RUNNING/PENDING/TIMEOUT/RESUMING) do NOT pass — the run hasn't
finished — but they classify as INFRA_TRANSIENT (wait for NEL to resume/finish;
not a real regression), distinct from a terminal FAILED.
