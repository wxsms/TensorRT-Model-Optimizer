# Contributing to Model Optimizer

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Model Optimizer (ModelOpt)!

## 🛠️ Setting up your environment

Ensure that Model Optimizer (ModelOpt) is installed in editable mode and that all `dev` optional requirements are installed:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If you are working on features that require dependencies like TensorRT-LLM or Megatron-Core, consider using a docker container to simplify the setup process.
Visit our [installation docs](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/getting_started/2_installation.html) for more information.

## 🧹 Code linting and formatting

- All code (Python, C++, Markdown, etc.) is automatically checked to adhere to the coding standards upon commit (see below for more information).
- See [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](.pre-commit-config.yaml) for details about each tool.
- For VSCode or Cursor, we provide default workspace settings to integrate the linting tools into your IDE: see [workspace settings](./.vscode/settings.json).

### Pre-commit hooks

Enable pre-commit hooks to automatically check and fix code quality before committing:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

If you want to make a temporary commit that skips checks, use the `-n` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -m "temporary commit" -n
```

To run the pre-commit hooks without committing, use:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## 🔒 Security coding practices

All contributors must follow the security coding practices documented in *Security Coding Practices for
Contributors* section of [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#security-coding-practices-for-contributors) page.

Any security-sensitive exception requires review and approval from `@NVIDIA/modelopt-setup-codeowners`.

## 📋 Copying code from other sources

The utilization of third-party code requires authorization via the Open Source Review Board (OSRB) team and needs to follow proper guidance on contributing code.

If you are an external contributor, seek guidance from `@NVIDIA/modelopt-setup-codeowners` for next steps. For internal contributors, follow the steps below:

- **File NVBug for use of open-source code:**
  Clone NVBug 2885977 and add your use case. Copying code from permissive licensed repositories (e.g. MIT, Apache 2) is generally self-checkout but for other licenses, it is necessary to get expert guidance before merging your PR.
- **License header format:** The file which has code copied from another third-party GitHub repository should have the following in order:
  1. A reference link (with commit hash) to the source from which the code was copied.
  1. The original repository's Copyright / License.
  1. The NVIDIA Apache 2.0 Copyright / License header.

  See [`modelopt/torch/speculative/eagle/utils.py`](./modelopt/torch/speculative/eagle/utils.py)
  for an example of the correct license header format.
- **Exclude from license pre-commit hook:** Exclude copied files from the license pre-commit hook so it doesn't auto-add the NVIDIA Apache 2.0 license on top of the file. Add the file path to the `exclude` list in the `insert-license` hook in [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](./.pre-commit-config.yaml).

## 📝 Writing tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for all tests. For any new features / examples, make sure to add tests and that the coverage check in your PR passes. The tests are organized into the following directories:

- `tests/unit`: Fast cpu-based unit tests for the core ModelOpt library. They should not take more than a few seconds to run.
- `tests/gpu`: Fast GPU-based unit tests for the core ModelOpt library. In most cases, they should not take more than a few seconds to run.
- `tests/gpu_megatron`: Fast GPU-based unit tests for the core ModelOpt library for Megatron-Core features. In most cases, they should not take more than a few seconds to run.
- `tests/gpu_trtllm`: Fast GPU-based unit tests for the core ModelOpt library for TensorRT-LLM features. In most cases, they should not take more than a few seconds to run.
- `tests/examples`: Integration tests for ModelOpt examples. They should not take more than a few minutes to run. Please refer to [example test README](./tests/examples/README.md) for more details.

Please refer to [tox.ini](./tox.ini) for more details on how to run the tests and their dependencies.

## ✍️ Signing your work

- We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original
  work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

- You need to cryptographically sign-off your commits as well using an SSH/GPG key which is different than the one used for authentication. See [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) for more details. Note that setting up the SSH key is much simpler than the GPG key hence recommended to use SSH signing key following the steps below (requires `git>=2.34`).

  - Generate a new SSH key as per steps [in this doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key). For example:

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f "${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519_git_signing" -P ""
    ```

  - Upload the public key (`cat "${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519_git_signing.pub"`) as a new SSH key in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) with an appropriate title and select key type as `Signing Key`.

  - Configure your local `git` to use the new SSH key for signing commits:

    ```bash
    git config --global user.signingkey "${HOME}/.ssh/id_ed25519_git_signing.pub"
    git config --global gpg.format ssh
    git config --global commit.gpgsign true
    ```

- **Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted**.

- Once you have set up your SSH/GPG key, to sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff --gpg-sign` (or `-s -S`) option when committing your changes:

  ```bash
  git commit -s -S -m "Add cool feature."
  ```

  > *TIP: To enable this for committing in VSCode, you can enable `git.alwaysSignOff` and `git.enableCommitSigning` in your VSCode settings (`Ctrl/Cmd + ,`).*

  This will append the following to your commit message:

  ```text
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
