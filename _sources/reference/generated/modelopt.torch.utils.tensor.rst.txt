.. List the submodules





.. Autodoc anything defined in the module itself

   TODO: WE DON'T USE THIS OPTION RIGHT NOW BUT WE CAN REACTIVATE IF WANTED
   We use :ignore-module-all: so sphinx does not document the same module twice, even if it is reimported
   For reimports that should be documented somewhere other than where they are defined, the re-imports
   __module__ should be manually overridden -- i.e. in the ``__init__.py`` which contains ``from xxx import YYY``,
   add in ``YYY.__module__ = __name__``.

.. automodule:: modelopt.torch.utils.tensor
   :members:
   :undoc-members:

   .. Also show members without docstrings. Only members from __all__ are considered as per conf.py
   .. Ideally we should add docstrings for these members.
