"""The vLLM dump resolves aux layers without modelopt -- so it can drift from it.

``compute_hidden_states_vllm.py`` runs in a stock vLLM container where importing
``modelopt.torch`` fails, so it carries its own copy of the preset logic. A copy that
nothing compares against is a copy that silently diverges: the 'eagle' preset -- which
is ``add_aux_layers_args``' *default* -- was missing from it entirely, so the documented
invocation died on ``int('eagle')`` before the dump began.

These tests pin the standalone resolver to the real ``hf_eagle`` helper. Unlike the
dump script, the unit suite *can* import modelopt, so the comparison is against the
actual source of truth rather than a third transcription of the formula -- a drift
guard written against its own copy would guard nothing.
