"""Run ``examples/megatron_bridge`` scripts without a ``torchrun`` launch per step.

A launch spends ~25s importing torch/megatron/modelopt before doing any work, and one example test
runs several. Single-rank commands drive the script's ``main()`` directly in the pytest process,
which is where that cost disappears (the suite goes from ~21min to ~4min on one GPU). Multi-rank
commands drive ``torchrun`` itself in-process, which only saves the launcher's own imports -- the
pytest process cannot be more than one rank -- but keeps torchrun's fresh worker processes.

The script's own ``get_args()`` still runs, so CLI flags and recipe strings stay covered. Not
covered: the ``torchrun`` invocation and the ``__main__`` block (``dist.setup()``, ``dist.abort()``
and ``dist.cleanup()``).

Megatron and torch.distributed.run are imported lazily on purpose: this module is imported at
collection time, and importing ``megatron.bridge`` initialises CUDA in the pytest process, which
would hold a context on device 0 for the whole session even when every step runs under torchrun.
