"""Unit tests for :mod:`modelopt.torch.export.trtllm.quant_utils`.

These helpers are reachable only from the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export path
(``trtllm/postprocess.py``), so they are tested alongside it rather than with the
backend-agnostic helpers in ``modelopt.torch.export.quant_utils``.

Test modules in this directory carry a ``trtllm_`` prefix because pytest runs without
``__init__.py`` here and derives the module name from the bare filename, so a plain
``test_quant_utils.py`` would collide with the one a directory up.
