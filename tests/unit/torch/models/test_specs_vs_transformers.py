"""Validate registered specs against the installed transformers definitions.

``test_model_specs.py`` pins spec values against a hand-written table. That catches an
accidental edit, but not a spec that is simply *wrong*: the table and the spec can be
wrong in the same way. ``gpt_oss`` shipped ``block_names=("GptOssMoE",)``, a class that
does not exist in transformers, and a mirrored table agreed with it.

This file reads the other side of the contract -- what transformers actually defines --
so a block class naming nothing real is caught at the source.

Nothing here names a model. Which specs to check, which cannot be checked, and which
transformers releases each applies to all come from the registry:

- ``modeling_source`` says whether the classes ship in transformers at all;
- ``min_transformers_version`` says from which release a spec's definitions apply, so an
  absence on an older transformers is an expected skip rather than a failure.

That second field is what lets these checks be assertions. Without it every check
degrades to "skip when not found", and a broken lookup would leave the suite green
having verified nothing.
