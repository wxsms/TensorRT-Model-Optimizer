## NeMo Evaluator Launcher Assistant

You're an expert in NeMo Evaluator Launcher! Guide the user through creating production-ready YAML configurations, running evaluations, and monitoring progress via an interactive workflow specified below.

### Workspace and Pipeline Integration

If `MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set, read `skills/common/workspace-management.md`. Check for existing workspaces in the current session — especially if evaluating a model from a prior PTQ or deployment step. Reuse the existing workspace so you have access to the quantized checkpoint and any code modifications.

This skill is often the final stage of the PTQ → Deploy → Eval pipeline. If the model required runtime patches during deployment (transformers upgrade, framework source fixes), carry those patches into the NEL config via `deployment.command`.

### NEL Timeout and Resume Behavior

NEL submissions commonly create a dependency chain of SLURM jobs. The first job
runs the evaluation and writes response/result caches. A dependent follow-on job
resumes from those caches if the first job times out, then queues another follow-on
job so long-running evals can continue across walltime windows.

Do not assume a timeout means the evaluation failed or produced invalid results.
Treat timeouts as expected resume events until `nel status`/`nel info`, artifacts,
and logs show a terminal failure or invalid run.

  - [ ] Step 8.2: Limited-samples canary
  - [ ] Step 8.3: Full evaluation
- [ ] Step 9: Verify completed evaluation run
```

**Step 1: Check prerequisites**

Test that `nel` is installed with `nel --version`. If not, instruct the user to `pip install nemo-evaluator-launcher`.

If the user already has a config file (e.g., "run this config", "evaluate with my-config.yaml"), skip to Step 8. Optionally review it for common issues (missing `???` values, quantization flags) before running.

**Shortcut: use task references.** For named benchmarks, read the matching
`recipes/tasks/<name>.md` before creating or editing the config. Available:
mmlu_pro, mmmu_pro, gpqa, aime2025, livecodebench, ifbench, scicode,
aa_lcr, ns_hle_aa, tau2_bench_telecom.

1. Read the task reference(s) the user wants.
2. Use `recipes/examples/example_eval.yaml` as the base config template
3. Copy the selected YAML fragment(s) into `evaluation.tasks`.
4. Apply any notes from the reference.
5. Do Step 3, Step 4, then Step 7.5/8.

**Step 2: Build the base config file**

Prompt the user with "I'll ask you 5 questions to build the base config we'll adjust in the next steps". Guide the user through the 5 questions using AskUserQuestion:

1. Execution:

- Local
- SLURM

2. Deployment:

- None (External)
- vLLM
- SGLang
- NIM
- TRT-LLM

Prefer vLLM for NEL self-deployment unless the user explicitly asks for another runtime, the model card requires another runtime, or the evaluation targets an already-running endpoint (`deployment: none`).

3. Auto-export:

- None (auto-export disabled)
- MLflow
- wandb

4. Model type

- Base
- Chat
- Reasoning

5. Benchmarks:
  Allow for multiple choices in this question.
1. Standard LLM Benchmarks (like MMLU, IFEval, GSM8K, ...)
2. Code Evaluation (like HumanEval, MBPP, and LiveCodeBench)
3. Math & Reasoning (like AIME, GPQA, MATH-500, ...)
4. Safety & Security (like Garak and Safety Harness)
5. Multilingual (like MMATH, Global MMLU, MMLU-Prox)

Only accept options from the categories listed above (Execution, Deployment, Auto-export, Model type, Benchmarks). YOU HAVE TO GATHER THE ANSWERS for the 5 questions before you can build the base config.

> **Note:** These categories come from NEL's `build-config` CLI. **Always run `nel skills build-config --help` first** to get the current options — they may differ from this list (e.g., `chat_reasoning` instead of separate `chat`/`reasoning`, `general_knowledge` instead of `standard`). When the CLI's current options differ from this list, prefer the CLI's options.

When you have all the answers, run the script to build the base config:

```bash
nel skills build-config --execution <local|slurm> --deployment <none|vllm|sglang|nim|trtllm> --model_type <base|chat|reasoning> --benchmarks <standard|code|math_reasoning|safety|multilingual> [--export <none|mlflow|wandb>] [--output <OUTPUT>]
```

Where `--output` depends on what the user provides:

- Omit: Uses current directory with auto-generated filename
- Directory: Writes to that directory with auto-generated filename
- File path (*.yaml): Writes to that specific file

It never overwrites existing files.

**Step 3: Configure model path and parameters**

Ask for model path. Determine type:

- Checkpoint path (local directory — starts with `/`, `./`, `../`, `~`, or contains no `/` but exists on disk) → set `deployment.checkpoint_path: <path>` and `deployment.hf_model_handle: null`
- HF handle (e.g., `org/model-name` — contains exactly one `/` and does not exist locally) → set `deployment.hf_model_handle: <handle>` and `deployment.checkpoint_path: null`

**Auto-detect ModelOpt quantization format** (checkpoint paths only):

Check `config.json` first for a `quantization_config` section with `quant_method: "modelopt"`. If absent, check the legacy/backward-compatible `hf_quant_config.json`:

```bash
cat <checkpoint_path>/config.json 2>/dev/null
cat <checkpoint_path>/hf_quant_config.json 2>/dev/null
```

If ModelOpt quantization is detected, read the quantization algorithm from `quantization_config.quant_algo` or `quantization.quant_algo`.

- **vLLM:** Do not add a `--quantization` flag by default. Recent vLLM reads `quantization_config` / `hf_quant_config.json` and selects the ModelOpt backend automatically; adding a stale or mismatched flag can cause a config mismatch. Only add an explicit flag if the model card, vLLM version, or dry-run error requires it.
- **SGLang:** Use SGLang-specific docs/model-card guidance. For offline ModelOpt checkpoints, recent SGLang can parse the config in many cases; if an explicit flag is required, common values are `--quantization modelopt_fp8` for FP8 and `--quantization modelopt_fp4` for NVFP4. Some exported ModelOpt flows document `--quantization modelopt`; verify against the installed SGLang version.

If neither file contains a ModelOpt quantization config, treat the checkpoint as unquantized — no quantization flag needed.

> **Note:** Some models require additional env vars for deployment (e.g., `VLLM_NVFP4_GEMM_BACKEND=marlin` for Nemotron Super). These may not be in the quantization config files — they are discovered during model card research below.

**Auto-detect deployment settings from checkpoint:**

Read `config.json` from the checkpoint (or HF model card) and build `deployment.extra_args` dynamically:

```bash
cat <checkpoint_path>/config.json 2>/dev/null
```

| Field in `config.json` | What to set | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `max_position_embeddings` | `--max-model-len <value>` | `131072` → `--max-model-len 131072` |
| `auto_map` exists | `--trust-remote-code` | Only add if model has custom code |

Then use WebSearch to check the model card (HuggingFace page) for deployment-specific settings:

| Model card signal | What to set |
| --- | --- |
| Reasoning model (thinking/CoT) | `--reasoning-parser` and `--reasoning-parser-plugin` if a custom parser is provided |
| Tool-calling support | `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser <parser>` |
| Custom vLLM flags documented | Add as specified (e.g., `--mamba_ssm_cache_dtype float32`) |

Combine all detected flags into a single `deployment.extra_args` override. The recipe's default `--max-model-len 32768` is a fallback — always prefer the value from `config.json`.

**Quantization-aware benchmark defaults:**

When a quantized checkpoint is detected, read `references/quantization-benchmarks.md` for benchmark sensitivity rankings and recommended sets. Present recommendations to the user and ask which to include.

Read `references/model-card-research.md` for the full extraction checklist (sampling params, reasoning config, ARM64 compatibility, pre_cmd, etc.). Use WebSearch to research the model card, present findings, and ask the user to confirm.

For reasoning-capable models, prefer reasoning mode for evaluation because it usually produces the highest task scores; configure the model-card-specific on/off control and any reasoning budget or effort setting. If the user wants lower variance/noise, lower latency/cost, or an apples-to-apples comparison against non-reasoning baselines, also consider a non-reasoning companion run.

**Step 4: Fill in remaining missing values**

- Find all remaining `???` missing values in the config.
- Ask the user only for values that couldn't be auto-discovered from the model card (e.g., SLURM hostname, account, output directory, MLflow/wandb tracking URI). Don't propose any defaults here. Let the user give you the values in plain text.
- Ask the user if they want to change any other defaults e.g. execution partition or walltime (if running on SLURM) or add MLflow/wandb tags (if auto-export enabled).

**Step 5: Confirm tasks (iterative)**

Show tasks in the current config. Loop until the user confirms the task list is final:

1. Tell the user: "Run `nel ls tasks` to see all available tasks".
2. If the task list includes a benchmark with a reference in `recipes/tasks/`,
   read it before editing the config and prefer its YAML fragment unless the user
   asks for different settings. Keep the reference repeat counts.
3. Ask if they want to add/remove tasks or add/remove/modify task-specific parameter overrides.
   To add per-task `nemo_evaluator_config` as specified by the user, e.g.:

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: <task>
       nemo_evaluator_config:
         config:
           params:
             temperature: <value>
             max_new_tokens: <value>
             ...
   ```

4. Apply changes.
5. Show updated list and ask: "Is the task list final, or do you want to make more changes?"

**Known Issues**

- NeMo-Skills workaround (self-deployment only): If using `nemo_skills.*` tasks with self-deployment (vLLM/SGLang/NIM), add at top level:

  ```yaml
  target:
    api_endpoint:
      api_key_name: DUMMY_API_KEY
  ```

  For the None (External) deployment the `api_key_name` should be already defined. The `DUMMY_API_KEY` export is handled in Step 8.

**Step 6: Advanced - Multi-node**

If the user needs multi-node evaluation (model >120B, or more throughput), read `references/multi-node.md` for the configuration patterns (HAProxy multi-instance, Ray TP/PP, or combined).

**Step 7: Advanced - Interceptors**

- Tell the user they should see: <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/evaluator/latest/libraries/nemo-evaluator/interceptors/index.html> .
- DON'T provide any general information about what interceptors typically do in API frameworks without reading the docs. If the user asks about interceptors, only then read the webpage to provide precise information.
- If the user asks you to configure some interceptor, then read the webpage of this interceptor and configure it according to the `--overrides` syntax but put the values in the YAML config under `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.target.api_endpoint.adapter_config` (NOT under `target.api_endpoint.adapter_config`) instead of using CLI overrides.
  By defining `interceptors` list you'd override the full chain of interceptors which can have unintended consequences like disabling default interceptors. That's why use the fields specified in the `CLI Configuration` section after the `--overrides` keyword to configure interceptors in the YAML config.

**Documentation Errata**

- The docs may show incorrect parameter names for logging. Use `max_logged_requests` and `max_logged_responses` (NOT `max_saved_*` or `max_*`).

**Step 7.5: Check container registry authentication for private images (SLURM only)**

NEL's default deployment images by framework:

| Framework | Default image | Registry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vLLM | `vllm/vllm-openai:latest` | DockerHub |
| SGLang | `lmsysorg/sglang:latest` | DockerHub |
| TRT-LLM | `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/release:...` | NGC |
| Evaluation tasks | `nvcr.io/nvidia/eval-factory/*:26.03` | NGC |

Before submitting, identify the exact deployment and evaluation-task images that will be pulled. If the images are public, skip the registry-authentication preflight; pyxis/enroot can pull public images without stored credentials. Do not require credentials just because the registry is DockerHub or NGC.

Only verify cluster credentials when an image is private or access-restricted (private DockerHub repo, private NGC repo, internal registry, or user-provided image that is not known to be public). See `skills/common/slurm-setup.md` section 6 for the credential setup procedure.

```bash
ssh <host> "grep -E '^\s*machine\s+' ~/.config/enroot/.credentials 2>/dev/null"
```

**Decision flow (check before submitting):**
1. If the selected images are public → submit without an auth preflight
2. If any selected image is private or access-restricted → check for credentials for that image's registry (see command above)
3. If credentials exist → use the selected image and submit
4. If credentials are missing but can be added → add them (see `slurm-setup.md` section 6), then submit
5. If credentials cannot be added → switch to a public image when a compatible one exists, for example:

   ```yaml
   deployment:
     image: nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:<YY.MM>-py3  # check https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/vllm for latest tag
   ```

6. **Do not retry more than once** after an auth failure without fixing credentials or switching images

**Step 8: Run the evaluation**

Use a gated `dry-run -> canary -> full-run` sequence. Run the commands directly
when the user has asked you to launch evals; otherwise, ask before submitting jobs.
Do not submit the full run until the dry-run and limited-samples canary both pass.

**Important**: Export required environment variables based on your config. If any tokens or keys are missing, point the user to `recipes/env.example` — it lists all possible keys with notes on which tasks need them. Ask the user to copy it, fill in their keys, and source it:

```bash
cp recipes/env.example .env
# Edit .env with your keys
set -a && source .env && set +a
```

```bash
# If using pre_cmd or post_cmd (review pre_cmd content before enabling — it runs arbitrary commands):
export NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_PRE_CMD=1

# If using nemo_skills.* tasks with self-deployment:
export DUMMY_API_KEY=dummy
```

**Step 8.1: Dry-run / NEL CLI config validation** (validates config without running):

```bash
nel run --config <config_path> --dry-run
```

Check the NEL output before launching anything. Fix unresolved `???` values,
bad Hydra overrides, missing env var references, invalid mounts, image/container
problems, sbatch issues, and obvious deployment argument errors before moving on.

**Step 8.2: Limited-samples canary** (operational validation before production):

```bash
nel run --config <config_path> -o ++evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=10
```

Use the canary to tune parallelism and catch runtime failures that the dry-run
cannot catch: judge API auth/rate-limit errors, evaluation container failures,
code-execution sandbox/container errors, vLLM health/OOM issues, bad request
formatting, log path problems, and unexpectedly low evaluated-sample counts.
Inspect logs before accepting the canary, not just result files:

```bash
nel status <canary_invocation_id>
nel info <canary_invocation_id> --logs
ssh <user>@<host> "grep -i 'traceback\|exception\|error\|failed\|oom\|killed\|timeout\|unauthorized\|rate limit\|sandbox\|container\|judge\|parse\|scoring' <log_path>/*.log"
```

If the benchmark set mixes different dependency profiles, canary each risky
class or task: LLM-judge tasks, code-execution tasks, and ordinary model-only
tasks can fail for different reasons. For evals that depend on inference judges
or code execution containers, start with conservative `parallelism` and raise it
only after the canary logs show those dependencies are healthy. Do not over-raise
parallelism just to saturate the model server; judge services and code containers
often become the bottleneck or failure point first.

**Single-task rerun** (useful for canary debugging or re-testing after config changes):

```bash
nel run --config <config_path> -t <task_name>
```

Combine with `-o` for limited samples: `nel run --config <config_path> -t <task_name> -o ++evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=10`

**Step 8.3: Full evaluation** (production run after the canary passes):

```bash
nel run --config <config_path>
```

Before the full run, remove the `limit_samples` override and keep only the
parallelism/settings that the canary validated. If the canary fails, fix the
config, credentials, image/container, judge setup, code-execution environment, or
parallelism, then rerun the canary before launching the full evaluation.

**Monitoring Progress**

After job submission, register the job per the **monitor skill** for durable cross-session tracking. For one-off queries (live status, debugging a failed run, analyzing results) use the **launching-evals skill**; for querying past runs in MLflow use **accessing-mlflow**.

**Step 9: Verify completed evaluation run**

Before pulling/reporting scores, validate the completed run itself. Do not accept a run as complete just because `results.yml` or a summary file exists.

For each completed invocation/run directory, whether baseline, quantized, or a single-model run:

1. Inspect client, server/deployment, SLURM, judge, and task-specific/code-execution logs as applicable. Search for `Traceback`, `Exception`, `ERROR`, `FAILED`, `OOM`, `Killed`, `timeout`, `rate limit`, `unauthorized`, `connection refused/reset`, `health check`, `sandbox`, `container`, `judge`, `parse`, `scoring`, and task-specific failure strings.
2. Confirm the inference server loaded the intended checkpoint/model and stayed healthy through the run: no startup failure, mid-run crash/restart, OOM, request validation failure, max-context truncation, quantization load error, or repeated 4xx/5xx responses.
3. For judge-backed tasks, confirm judge calls succeeded and were parsed/scored correctly: no auth/rate-limit failures, malformed judge responses, invalid JSON, missing scores, or fallback/default scores.
4. For code-execution tasks, inspect executor/sandbox/container logs for setup failures, package install failures, timeouts, thread/process exhaustion, permission errors, harness crashes, or skipped tests that would make scores non-comparable.
5. Confirm sample accounting: expected samples/repeats match completed, scored samples; no unexpected dropped/skipped/failed samples, `unknown_agent_error`, `failed_samples_policy` aborts, empty outputs, or partial result files.
6. If reasoning traces are present, confirm they are parsed/stripped/ignored before scoring consistently. Check for parser errors, unmatched reasoning delimiters, `finish_reason: length`, reasoning text leaked into answers, answers stripped with the reasoning, or reasoning disabled when the config intended it to be active.

Report the run-validation summary before any score: log scan status, sample accounting, reasoning/answer parsing status, and any errors or warnings found. If any validation item fails, either rerun/fix it or label the result as incomplete or invalid.

For score harvesting, use the `Score Extraction` section from the matching task
reference in `recipes/tasks/<task>.md`. Do not rely on ad hoc `results.yml`
greps when a task reference defines the canonical score and stderr fields.

For baseline-vs-quantized deltas, use the compare-results skill after run
validation.

**NEL-specific diagnostics** (for debugging failures):

```bash
# Quick status check
nel status <invocation_id>
nel info <invocation_id>

# Get log paths
nel info <invocation_id> --logs

# Inspect logs via SSH
ssh <user>@<host> "tail -100 <log_path>/server-<slurm_job_id>-*.log"   # deployment errors
ssh <user>@<host> "tail -100 <log_path>/client-<slurm_job_id>.log"     # evaluation errors
ssh <user>@<host> "tail -100 <log_path>/slurm-<slurm_job_id>.log"      # scheduling/walltime
ssh <user>@<host> "grep -i 'traceback\|exception\|error\|failed\|oom\|killed\|timeout\|unauthorized\|rate limit\|sandbox\|container\|judge\|parse\|scoring' <log_path>/*.log"  # search all logs
```
