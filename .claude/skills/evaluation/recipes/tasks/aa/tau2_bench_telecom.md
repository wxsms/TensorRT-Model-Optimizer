# Tau2 Bench Telecom

## Task Details

- Reference: <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/evaluator/latest/evaluation/benchmarks/catalog/all/harnesses/tau2_bench.html#tau2-bench-tau2-bench-telecom>

## Params

Tau2 Bench uses the evaluated model as the agent and a separate LLM endpoint as
the user simulator. Configure the user simulator explicitly and keep it fixed
across comparable runs.

For parallelism, we have to throttle to a smaller cap due to the test may be throttled by
user and judger API rate limit. If frequent 429 errors are hit, the reported scores could be much lower.

The `parallelism:` field is left as `???` — the right value depends on the
judge and user-simulator endpoints' rate limits, which vary per deployment.
Start with a conservative canary value (e.g. 32–128), watch the logs for 429
errors from the judger/user endpoints, and ramp up if stable. The hard
upper bound is 512. After choosing a value, recompute the deployment's
`--max-num-seqs` per the rule in SKILL.md Step 3.
