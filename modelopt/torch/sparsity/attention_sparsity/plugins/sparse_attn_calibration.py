"""vLLM-free helpers for skip-softmax calibration through a serving engine.

The serving adapters (``plugins/vllm.py``) record **raw per-threshold tile
counts** per scheduled request. These helpers merge those counts — across the
layers of one rank and across tensor-parallel ranks — then fit the exponential
threshold model and build the canonical ``sparse_attention_config`` block.

Counts are additive, so aggregation is a plain sum: every layer of a rank and
every TP rank observes the same launches in the same order (TP ranks each see
their head shard), which makes records align by index within a phase. Fitting
happens once, per phase, on the globally merged counts — never per rank
(head-sharded counts are incomplete) and never by averaging independently
fitted coefficients (the fit is nonlinear).

Everything here operates on plain Python data and is unit-testable without
vLLM installed.
