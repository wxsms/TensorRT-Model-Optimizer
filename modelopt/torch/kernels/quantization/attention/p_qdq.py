"""Softmax-P quant-dequant helpers for the unified flash attention kernel.

These ``@triton.jit`` helpers fake-quantize the softmax probabilities ``P``
before the ``P @ V`` matmul (BMM2) — the in-kernel counterpart of the
``p_bmm_quantizer`` config. They are called conditionally from the baseline
flash-attention kernel in ``common/attention/triton_fa.py`` under the
``P_QDQ`` constexpr guard, following the same composition pattern as
the sparsity helpers in ``sparsity/attention/skip_softmax_helpers.py``.

Only NVFP4 needs a P-specific helper (tiling policy and block amaxes); the
per-tensor FP8 mode uses ``quantization/common/fp8_quant.fp8_scalar_qdq``
directly. What is P-specific here: the kernel's online-softmax ``p`` is
unnormalized and bounded (``0 <= p <= 1``, since the max-subtraction caps
every entry at ``exp2(0) = 1``), so 1 is the theoretical upper bound of its
amax; block amaxes need no ``abs``; and the NVFP4 scale blocks of 16 run
along the key dimension — the contraction axis of ``P @ V``. The caller
(``attention()``) converts the amax to the ``global_scale`` below.
