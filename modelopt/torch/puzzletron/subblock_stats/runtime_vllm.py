"""vLLM Runtime Benchmark Integration for ModelOpt NAS Subblocks.

This module provides the integration logic to empirically benchmark subblock
runtime statistics within transformer architectures using the vLLM latency
benchmark. Each invocation is launched in a dedicated subprocess so that GPU
memory and CUDA state are fully reclaimed when the subprocess exits, allowing
many sequential benchmarks to run in a single Python session without leaking.

Usage:
    - Call `run_vllm_latency_benchmark` with a model path and a
      `RuntimeConfig` instance to run a latency benchmark and
      return the average latency for the configuration (in milliseconds).
