"""Self-implemented final (pre-lm_head) norms for the offline/streaming fake base model.

FakeBaseModel reconstructs base logits from vLLM-captured final hidden states, which are
*un-normed* — so it must re-apply the base model's final norm before lm_head. We reimplement a
small, explicit set of norm variants here (rather than importing each base model's real module)
to keep the fake base lightweight, and map base ``model_type`` → norm type so a norm is applied
only when we know which one the model uses.
