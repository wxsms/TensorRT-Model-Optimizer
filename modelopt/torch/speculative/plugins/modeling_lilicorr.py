"""LiLiCorr draft module — DFlash backbone plus a lattice reranker over its candidates.

LiLiCorr (NVIDIA, "LiLiCorr: Lightweight Likelihood Correlation of Parallel Drafts
for Speculative Decoding", https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.20530) addresses the failure
mode a purely parallel drafter has: DFlash is trained on per-position *marginals*
rather than the joint block distribution, so the tokens it emits are individually
plausible yet jointly incoherent.

Instead of committing the per-slot argmax, the drafter keeps its top-``k``
candidates at each of the ``block_size - 1`` slots and LiLiCorr scores the
resulting lattice:

- Each candidate is embedded, projected, and combined with an **anchor** — one
  projected row of the committed target hidden state, the position immediately
  before the block. Rank and log-probability features from the drafter's own
  distribution are concatenated in, so the head sees how confident the drafter was
  and how close the near-ties are.
- A small bidirectional transformer over the ``slots x k`` lattice produces one
  hidden state per candidate (:class:`LiLiCorrLayer`).
- Two heads read it: ``out_head`` and ``in_head``. Adjacent candidates *match*
  when the earlier one's ``out`` vector has high cosine similarity with the later
  one's ``in`` vector, so the block's joint structure is captured without the
  joint distribution ever being materialized.

The factors are bounded by construction: every bilinear operand is L2-normalized
along ``factor_dim``, so each score is a cosine in ``[-1, 1]`` and the factor
magnitude is set solely by a fixed, non-learnable ``logit_scale``. That is what
makes the selection stable without a clamp, a squash, or a separate grad clip.

Serving commits a path greedily, left to right. Greedy is deliberate, not an
approximation: speculative decoding accepts the longest correct *prefix*, so every
prefix event contributes to ``E[tau]`` and the early ones dominate. Maximizing the
whole-block score instead (exactly solvable by Viterbi over this chain) trades an
early slot for a better tail, which is rational for the path score and
self-defeating for prefix acceptance.

This module owns the head parameters only; the training wrapper
(``HFLiLiCorrModel`` in ``hf_lilicorr.py``) orchestrates the forward, the
three-term objective and the metrics. Submodule names (``token_proj`` /
``pass_hidden_proj`` / ``feature_mlp`` / ``slot_embedding`` / ``rank_embedding`` /
``relative_slot_bias`` / ``same_slot_bias`` / ``context_proj`` / ``output_norm`` /
``anchor_norm`` / ``factor_input_proj`` / ``out_head`` / ``in_head`` /
``anchor_out_head``) match the serving loader, so an exported checkpoint is served
directly.

        ``DFlashDecoderLayer`` already exposes, so the convolution itself is shared code
        rather than a second implementation of the same arithmetic.

        The initialization is the one deliberate difference. DFlash2 draws
        ``kernel_projection`` from ``normal_(0, initializer_range)``, so its convolution
        is not the identity at step 0. Here it is zero by default, and since
        ``base_kernel`` is identity at tap 0 the whole wrapper is then an *exact*
        identity at init: ``prepare`` emits a zero dynamic kernel, ``coefficients ==
        base``, and the convolution returns its input unchanged. That makes the
        difference between a conv and a non-conv run attributable to the convolutions
        rather than to a perturbed starting point.

        ``conv_projection_init_std`` is a separate key from ``initializer_range`` on
        purpose: the latter also seeds the reranker, so overloading it would couple two
        unrelated initializations.

        The import is deferred to here rather than taken at module scope because
        ``modeling_dflash2`` is the only part of LiLiCorr that needs DFlash2 at all.
        Importing it eagerly would make the whole plugin -- including the plain
        reranker, which shares no code with DFlash2 -- unimportable wherever DFlash2 is
        absent. Deferring it keeps that cost on the one recipe that asks for it.
