"""DFlash2 draft module — DFlash backbone plus local convolution and candidate selection.

DFlash2 (Inco AI / Z Lab, https://inco.ai/blog/dflash2/) keeps DFlash's one-pass
parallel backbone and adds two small components that address the two ways a
purely parallel draft loses acceptance:

- :class:`DFlashGroupedConv` — a grouped *dynamic* depthwise convolution wrapped
  around every attention and MLP sublayer. Each block position mixes in its
  predecessors inside the block, which injects the intra-block sequential
  dependency the parallel backbone lacks (mitigating suffix acceptance decay)
  without a second backbone pass. Taps do not cross the block boundary.

- :class:`CandidateSelector` — a low-rank transition scorer. Instead of an
  independent argmax per block position, the drafter keeps the target head's
  top-k candidates per position and scores adjacent transitions, so serving can
  walk one coherent path through the block.

Where Domino uses a GRU and DSpark a Markov transition bias, DFlash2 spends its
extra capacity on these two pieces: both are cheap (a few percent of draft
parameters, ~1% of serving step latency in the reference measurements).

This module owns the parameters only; the training wrapper (``HFDFlash2Model``
in ``hf_dflash2.py``) orchestrates the forward and the selector loss. Module and
parameter names (``attention_conv`` / ``mlp_conv`` / ``base_kernel`` /
``kernel_projection`` / ``candidate_selector`` / ``predecessor_codebook`` /
``successor_codebook`` / ``hidden_projection``) match the SGLang and vLLM
``DFlash2DraftModel`` loaders so an exported checkpoint is served directly.

    deltas.

    Both halves start as a no-op: ``base_kernel`` is an identity (tap 0 weight 1,
    later taps 0) and ``kernel_projection`` is zero-initialized, so ``delta`` is
    zero and a freshly built DFlash2 draft computes exactly what its DFlash
    backbone would. That makes the convolution a stable extension rather than a
    perturbation. Matches the reference implementation (SpecForge #772) and the
