"""LiLiCorr speculative decoding plugin for HuggingFace models.

LiLiCorr (NVIDIA, "LiLiCorr: Lightweight Likelihood Correlation of Parallel Drafts
for Speculative Decoding", https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.20530) reuses the DFlash draft
backbone and adds a reranker over the candidate lattice the backbone already produces
(see ``modeling_lilicorr.LiLiCorrModule``).

The backbone is trained on per-position *marginals*, so the tokens it emits are
individually plausible yet jointly incoherent. Rather than committing the per-slot
argmax, LiLiCorr keeps the top-``k`` candidates per slot and scores transitions
between them, then commits a path greedily. This module trains that scorer jointly
with the backbone.

The objective adds three weighted terms to the DFlash loss::

    loss = dflash_loss + w_ce * L_ce + w_margin * L_margin + w_pen * L_pen

- ``L_ce``: a softmax over each slot's ``k`` candidate scores, pushing the
  ground-truth candidate up and the competing ones down.
- ``L_margin``: a hinge on the same scores, pushing the ground-truth candidate above
  the best competing one by ``margin``. Zero-gradient once it already wins by that
  much, so capacity goes to the near-ties.
- ``L_pen``: the head's own probability mass on the competing candidates, each
  weighted by the target model's logit gap to the ground truth — so a candidate the
  target finds plausible is penalized lightly and a confident wrong one hard.

The weights are absolute, with no outer multiplier, so
``loss == origin_loss + lilicorr_loss`` holds exactly. Two variants ship and differ
*only* in composition — ``base`` (w_ce 0.25, w_margin 0) and ``margin``
(0.125 / 0.125), both with ``w_pen`` 0.25 — so the second variant is two recipe
lines rather than a second implementation.
