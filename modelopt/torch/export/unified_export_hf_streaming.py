    The offloaded counterpart of :func:`_export_transformers_checkpoint`, which builds the
    whole quantized state dict at once and so needs every weight resident. Here each
    decoder layer is materialized, exported, and written to a shard file before the next
    one is touched, bounding peak memory at one layer plus one shard buffer.

    Model-level preparation (MoE input handling, resmooth/requantize, quant config) matches
    the resident path. The per-tensor work does not: instead of ``postprocess_state_dict``
    over a finished dict, each tensor goes through :func:`_postprocess_single_tensor` as it
    is produced. Two consequences follow from having no whole-dict view:

    - Tied weights are dropped by *name* from ``_tied_weights_keys`` (data_ptr is meaningless
      once weights move host<->device); see the TODO below on adopting ``all_tied_weights_keys``.
    - Conversion mappings that need tensor-level splits cannot be reversed one tensor at a
      time, so they are rejected up front rather than exported incorrectly.

    Args:
        model: the full torch model to export, carrying accelerate offload hooks.
        dtype: weight dtype for unquantized layers, or the model's dtype if None.
        is_modelopt_qlora: whether the model is a ModelOpt QLoRA model.
        export_dir: directory to write shards and config artifacts into.
        max_shard_size: shard size limit, as bytes or a string such as ``"10GB"``.
        extra_state_dict: tensors the model itself never holds (e.g. MTP weights, which HF
            leaves orphaned) and which would otherwise be missing from the export.

    Returns:
        ``(None, quant_config)``. No state dict is returned because none is ever
        assembled; shards, ``config.json``, and ``generation_config.json`` are written to
        ``export_dir`` directly. The caller writes ``hf_quant_config.json`` and merges
        ``quantization_config`` into ``config.json``.
