"""Custom mapping from Qwen3.5-VL Hugging Face models to Megatron Core models.

Qwen3.5 interleaves GatedDeltaNet linear-attention layers (fused ``in_proj``, split here into
HF's ``in_proj_qkv`` / ``_z`` / ``_b`` / ``_a``) with gated full-attention layers, and adds MoE
shared experts. Only the language model is exported; the vision tower is copied from HF.
Routed experts are packed as ``[num_experts, out, in]``, exported from either expert layout.
