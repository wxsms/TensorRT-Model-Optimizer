"""Custom mapping from Qwen3-VL Hugging Face models to Megatron Core models.

Qwen3-VL differs from Qwen3 in one structural way: language-model weights live
under ``model.language_model.`` instead of ``model.``, while ``lm_head.weight``
remains at the root level.  The mappings below are derived automatically from
the Qwen3 mappings by inserting ``language_model.`` after ``model.`` for every
prefix that starts with ``model.``.

Note: the visual encoder (``model.visual.*``) is intentionally excluded — this
mapping covers only the language-model decoder used for quantization and export.

Note: ``Qwen3VLMoeForConditionalGeneration`` is **not** supported here.  The MoE
variant stores expert weights as 3-D tensors (``mlp.experts.gate_up_proj``,
``mlp.experts.down_proj``) that require a dedicated fused-expert mapping and
cannot reuse the dense Qwen3 rules.
