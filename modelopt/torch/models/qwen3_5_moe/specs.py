"""Qwen3.5-MoE specs (HF model type ``qwen3_5_moe``)."""

# No ExportSpec.grouped_expert_export here, which preserves pre-refactor behavior: the
# legacy get_experts_list keyed off ``type(root_model).__name__.lower()``, and
# "qwen3_5moeforcausallm" matched none of its qwen substrings (the "_5" breaks
# "qwen3moeforcausallm"), so Qwen3.5-MoE raised NotImplementedError there. The layout
# looks identical to qwen3_moe, so enabling it is likely correct -- but that is a
# behavior change and belongs in its own PR with validation.
