"""DeepSeek-V3 specs (HF model type ``deepseek_v3``).

Covers the transformers-native V3 family (V3, R1, V3.1). The remote-code
``DeepseekMoE`` block of DeepSeek-MoE is a separate spec under ``deepseek``.

# DeepseekV3MoE is invisible to the generic MoE detection: its class name does not end
# in "SparseMoeBlock" and it calls its router ``gate``, so neither the name test nor the
# structural router+experts test in is_moe matches. block_names below is what puts it on
# the MoE path at all.
#
# The experts container changed upstream. transformers 4.57 builds an nn.ModuleList of
# DeepseekV3MLP, which is the naming recorded here; 5.x replaces it with a fused, 3-D
# DeepseekV3Experts holding gate_up_proj/down_proj. The fused layout resolves through
# the structural first-projection check in get_expert_linear_names and never consults
# this naming -- the same split Mixtral has across the same releases.
