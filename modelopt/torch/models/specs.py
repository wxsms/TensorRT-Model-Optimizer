"""Per-model descriptors and the registry indexing them by HF model type.

``ModelSpec`` is the one global descriptor of a model: everything modelopt knows
about a model type lives on a single instance, resolved by ``config.model_type``.
It holds each concern as a separate, optional section object:

- **topic sections** hold architecture facts shared across subsystems (``MoESpec``:
  what a model's MoE blocks are);
- **subsystem sections** hold one subsystem's per-model data (``ExportSpec``).

A section is ``None`` when the model has nothing to say about it -- a dense model
carries ``moe_spec=None`` rather than an empty ``MoESpec``, so "not an MoE model" and
"an MoE model whose layout is not filled in yet" stay distinguishable.

Sections hold per-model data plus trivial accessors over that data; subsystem logic
never lives here. A model registers exactly one ``ModelSpec`` in its own ``specs.py``
at import time; importing the package registers them all. Lookups return ``None`` (or
an empty list) when nothing matches, so callers can fail loudly or fall back per their
own policy.

The registry lives here rather than beside these classes because it is not a separate
concept: every lookup takes or returns a ``ModelSpec``, and it has to know how one is
composed. Matching is by model-type and class-name strings only, so this module needs
no torch import.
