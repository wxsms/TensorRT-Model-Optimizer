    ``unexpected_keys`` is what ``from_pretrained(..., output_loading_info=True)`` reports: keys
    found in the checkpoint but not expected by the model's architecture. That is the loader's own
    accounting, produced while loading, so it already reflects any on-the-fly name conversion --
    unlike re-deriving the set afterwards, which has to replay the conversion plan to avoid
    mistaking a renamed key for an unplaced one.

    How Transformers decides what it has seen
    -----------------------------------------
    The index (``model.safetensors.index.json``) selects which FILES the loader opens, not which
    TENSORS it sees. Within a file it opens, it enumerates every tensor present and reports the
    ones the architecture does not expect. Two consequences, both load-bearing here:

    * A tensor missing from ``weight_map`` but physically present in a shard the index names for
      OTHER tensors is still reported. An MTP head stored inside a main shard is exactly this
      shape -- when MTP is not quantized the model never declares it, so it arrives here like any
      other unplaced key. The corollary is the one that is easy to get wrong: the index is not an
      inventory of the checkpoint, so looking such a key up in ``weight_map`` to find its file
      returns nothing. :func:`~modelopt.torch.export.unified_export_hf._locate_source_keys` falls
      back to scanning shard headers for precisely this reason; resolving through ``weight_map``
      alone used to drop these tensors from the export silently.
    * A tensor in a file the index never names is NOT reported -- the loader never opened it, so
      it had no opportunity to call anything unexpected. Those are handled by
      :func:`~modelopt.torch.utils.plugins.hf_checkpoint_utils.copy_off_index_safetensors`, which
      copies the file whole rather than paying host memory to re-serialise it.

    This is observed behaviour, established by experiment against transformers 5.3.0 (a shard
    holding one tensor the index omitted reported it; a file the index never named reported
    nothing), not a published contract. Nothing here depends on it holding: a key that the loader does report is
    located by header scan whether or not the index lists it, and a file the loader ignores is
    copied verbatim regardless.

    Prefer this over :func:`unplaced_source_keys` whenever the loading info is available.
