    :meth:`start` opens the run *before* the expensive work begins, so a bad URI, a missing
    token or an unreachable server fails there rather than after hours; it also
    uploads the invocation and any configuration passed to it, which keeps a crashed run
    useful. :meth:`finish` uploads the captured log plus any outputs and closes the run.
    Everything is a no-op when ``enabled`` is false, so callers need no branching.

    While the run is open, ``stdout``/``stderr`` are teed to a file that is uploaded as
    ``logs/<script>.log``. Logging handlers that libraries bound to ``sys.stderr`` at import
    time are re-pointed at the tee for the duration and handed back afterwards.

    Failures after the run is open are reported as warnings and never raised: losing a
    tracking server must not turn a successful job into a failed one.

    Note:
        ``command.txt`` masks ``--*token*``-style option values and credentials embedded in
        a URI, but the captured log is whatever the script printed, so a secret echoed to
        stdout still reaches the server. Prefer passing credentials via the environment.

    *tracking_uri* must already be validated (see :func:`validate_tracking_uri`),
    *experiment_name* is created if absent, *run_name* defaults to the UTC start time
    ``YYYYmmdd-HHMMSS``, and ``enabled=False`` makes every method a no-op -- which is how
    callers skip non-main ranks or an absent flag. ``required=False`` additionally downgrades
    a failure to open the run into a warning: use it when tracking was inferred from the
    environment rather than asked for, so an uninstalled client or an unreachable server
    cannot take the job down with it.

    Example:
        >>> logger = MlflowRunLogger(uri, "alice/hf_ptq/Qwen3-0.6B-nvfp4")
