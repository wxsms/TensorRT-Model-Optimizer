"""Convenience factory helpers for constructing the auxiliary DMD networks.

These helpers are intentionally tiny — the training framework is free to build the
fake score directly (e.g. under a meta-init context for FSDP2) instead of calling
:func:`create_fake_score`. See the ModelOpt ↔ FastGen design doc (FASTGEN_MODELOPT.md,
section "How the framework can build the fake_score") for both options.

    This is the unit-test / single-script path; frameworks that do meta-init + FSDP2
    wrapping will typically construct the fake score themselves and pass it directly
    into :class:`~modelopt.torch.fastgen.methods.dmd.DMDPipeline`.

    Args:
        teacher: The already-built teacher module. Must already have its weights loaded.
        deep_copy: If True, :func:`copy.deepcopy` the teacher; if False, reuse the same
            instance (only sensible if the caller can guarantee it is no longer held
            elsewhere as the frozen teacher).

    Returns:
        A copy of ``teacher`` in training mode with all parameters requiring gradients.

    FSDP2 caveat
    ------------
    ``copy.deepcopy(teacher)`` is **not safe** when the teacher is already FSDP2-wrapped
    (DTensor parameters + FSDP pre/post hooks + meta-init bookkeeping). For Stage-2 FSDP2
    training, skip this factory and construct the fake score under meta-init, then
    rank-0-load weights and let ``sync_module_states`` broadcast::

        with meta_init_context():
            fake_score = build_teacher_from_config(teacher_config)
        if is_rank0():
            fake_score.load_state_dict(teacher.state_dict(), strict=False)
        # Wrap with FSDP2(..., sync_module_states=True) to broadcast from rank 0.

    The pattern mirrors FastGen's
    ``methods/distribution_matching/dmd2.py::DMD2Model.build_model``. A dedicated
    ``create_fake_score_meta`` factory is planned alongside the Stage-2 training example.

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: When ``deep_copy=True`` and the teacher looks FSDP-wrapped
            (either FSDP1 via ``_fsdp_wrapped_module`` or FSDP2 via DTensor
            parameters). The ``deep_copy=False`` branch skips the check because
            reusing the teacher directly is compatible with an FSDP-wrapped input.
