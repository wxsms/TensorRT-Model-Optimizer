"""Framework-agnostic diffusion step-distillation losses (FastGen port).

``modelopt.torch.fastgen`` is a loss-computation library. It accepts already-built
``nn.Module`` references (student / teacher / fake-score / optional discriminator) and
returns scalar loss tensors. It does **not** load models, manage optimizers, wrap
anything as a ``DynamicModule``, or register itself in any mode registry.

Typical usage with a YAML-driven config::

    import modelopt.torch.fastgen as mtf

    student, teacher = build_wan_student_and_teacher(...)
    fake_score = mtf.create_fake_score(teacher)

    cfg = mtf.load_dmd_config("general/distillation/dmd2_qwen_image")

    # If GAN is enabled, expose intermediate teacher features to the discriminator.
    if cfg.gan_loss_weight_gen > 0:
        mtf.plugins.qwen_image.attach_feature_capture(teacher, feature_indices=[30])

    pipeline = mtf.DMDPipeline(student, teacher, fake_score, cfg, discriminator=disc)

    # Inside the training loop (framework-owned):
    if step % cfg.student_update_freq == 0:
        losses = pipeline.compute_student_loss(
            latents, noise, text_embeds, negative_encoder_hidden_states=neg_embeds
        )
        losses["total"].backward()
        student_opt.step()
        pipeline.update_ema()
    else:
        f = pipeline.compute_fake_score_loss(latents, noise, text_embeds)
        f["total"].backward()
        fake_score_opt.step()
        if disc is not None:
            d = pipeline.compute_discriminator_loss(latents, noise, text_embeds)
            d["total"].backward()
            disc_opt.step()
