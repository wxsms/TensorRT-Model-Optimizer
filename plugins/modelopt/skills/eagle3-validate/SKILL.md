# EAGLE3 Pipeline Validation

Verify that an EAGLE3 pipeline run completed successfully and meets quality criteria.

## Step 0 — Identify the experiment

Find the most recent experiment directory (or ask the user for the path):

```bash
ls -td experiments/cicd/cicd_* | head -5
```

Each experiment directory has one subdirectory per task (numbered 0–3), each containing a
log file whose name varies by launch mode (Slurm: `sbatch_*.out`, local Docker: `*.log`).

## Step 1 — Check task outcomes

Match the log files generally and read the tail of each:

```bash
find experiments/<exp_id>/ -type f \( -name '*.out' -o -name '*.log' \) | sort | while read -r f; do
  echo "=== $f ==="; tail -50 "$f"; echo
done
```

All 4 tasks must complete without error. Look for:
- `exit code: 0` or no error — success
- `DUE TO TIME LIMIT` — timeout
- `FAILED` / `signal` / exception traceback — failure

If any task failed, suggest running `/eagle3-triage` instead.

## Step 2 — Verify artifacts exist

Check each step produced the expected output (artifacts live on the cluster at `/scratchspace/`).
Confirm via log messages:

| Step | Expected log evidence | Artifact |
|------|-----------------------|----------|
| task_0 | "Saved N samples" or progress bar completing | `/scratchspace/data/*.jsonl` |
| task_1 | "Successfully processed N conversations" | `/scratchspace/offline_hidden_states/*.pt` |
| task_2 | Training loss decreasing, "export complete" | `/scratchspace/eagle3/model.safetensors`, `/scratchspace/export/` |
| task_3 | `Average Acceptance Length ... ratio: X.XX` | JSON result files |

## Step 3 — Check acceptance rate

In the task_3 log, find:

```text
Average Acceptance Length {'accept': X, 'count': Y, 'ratio': Z.ZZ}
```

The `ratio` field is the acceptance rate (AR).

| Criterion | Threshold | Status |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| AR (MT-Bench) | >= 2.1 | PASS / FAIL |

If the log shows `AR ... < lower bound`, the run already triggered a threshold failure (exit code 1).

## Step 4 — Check training quality

In the task_2 log look for:
- **Final training loss** — should be decreasing, not NaN
- **AR validation during training** (if `training.ar_validate_steps` was set)
- **Number of training steps** — confirms full training duration

## Step 5 — Produce validation report

```markdown
## EAGLE3 Pipeline Validation Report

**Experiment:** <exp_dir>
**Model:** <model_name>
**Date:** <date>
**Pipeline config:** <yaml_path>

### Step Status
| Step | Task | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Data synthesis | PASS/FAIL/TIMEOUT | N samples generated |
| 1 | Hidden state dump | PASS/FAIL | N .pt files |
| 2 | Training + export | PASS/FAIL | Final loss: X.XX |
| 3 | Benchmark | PASS/FAIL | AR: X.XX |

### Acceptance Rate
- MT-Bench AR: X.XX (threshold: >= 2.1) — PASS/FAIL

### Training Summary
- Final loss: X.XX
- Training steps: N
- AR during training: X.XX (if validated)

### Overall: PASS / FAIL
<one-line summary>
```

## Step 6 — Suggest next steps

**If PASS:**
- Record the verified result (and checkpoint path) in the team's internal triage tracker
- This model is now a candidate to add as a launcher example in a dedicated PR

**If FAIL:**
- Identify which step or metric failed
- Suggest running `/eagle3-triage` for diagnosis
- For a low AR, diagnose the specific cause from the run (training loss curve, data
  volume/quality, draft-head capacity, hyperparameters) and suggest fixes targeted to that
  scenario — low AR can have many causes, so avoid a generic checklist.
