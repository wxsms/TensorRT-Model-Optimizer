# Stage 4 — Validate a completed run

Verify that a pipeline run completed successfully end-to-end and meets its quality
gate.

## Step 0 — Identify the experiment

Find the most recent experiment directory (or ask the user for the path):

```bash
ls -td experiments/cicd/cicd_* | head -5
```

Each experiment directory has one subdirectory per task, each containing a log file
whose name varies by launch mode (Slurm: `sbatch_*.out`, local Docker: `*.log`).

## Step 1 — Check task outcomes

Match the log files generally and read the tail of each:

```bash
find experiments/<exp_id>/ -type f \( -name '*.out' -o -name '*.log' \) | sort | while read -r f; do
  echo "=== $f ==="; tail -50 "$f"; echo
done
```

Every task must complete without error. Look for:

- `exit code: 0` or no error — success
- `DUE TO TIME LIMIT` — timeout
- `FAILED` / `signal` / exception traceback — failure

If any task failed, go to `triage.md` instead.

## Step 2 — Verify artifacts exist

Check each task produced its expected output. The per-task log evidence and artifact
paths are in *Success markers* in `../algorithms/<algorithm>.md`.

A success line in a log is not proof the artifact survived — the next task reads it
from a shared `/scratchspace`, where it may be missing, empty, or unreadable. **When
you can reach the cluster, check the filesystem directly** and treat a missing or
zero-byte artifact as a validation failure:

```bash
test -s <artifact_path> && echo "ok: $(du -sh <artifact_path>)" || echo "MISSING/EMPTY"
ls -la <artifact_dir>/ | head
```

Fall back to log evidence only when the cluster isn't reachable, and say so in the
report rather than implying the artifacts were verified.

## Step 3 — Check the quality gate

Read *Quality gate* in `../algorithms/<algorithm>.md` first — **not every algorithm
produces an in-pipeline metric**, so what you check depends on the sheet:

- **Sheet defines a benchmark metric** (e.g. EAGLE3's MT-Bench AR, DFlash's
  `Average_AL`) — extract it from the benchmark task's log and compare against the
  threshold **yourself**. No benchmark step in this repo enforces one:
  `common/specdec_bench/quick_check.sh` and `run.sh` pass straight through to
  `specdec_bench/run.py`, which reads no threshold and never exits non-zero on a low
  metric, and no launcher example sets one. A green benchmark task therefore says the
  run finished, not that the metric passed. Reporting PASS without having read the
  number off the log is a false PASS on the run's headline metric.
- **Sheet defines no inference metric** (currently Domino and DSpark — their eval path
  runs the DFlash backbone with the new head bypassed, and Domino ships no benchmark
  task at all) — do **not** go looking for a benchmark log. Report the training
  regression gate instead, and state plainly that acceptance quality requires a
  separate evaluation of the exported checkpoint. Never report a backbone-only
  acceptance rate as the model's result.

Where the gate is the training regression check (`check_regression.py` against
`trainer_state.json`), confirm the `=== Regression Check ===` block is actually
present in the log — it is invoked with `|| true` and only warns when no
`trainer_state.json` exists, so a green exit does not prove it ran.

## Step 4 — Check training quality

In the training task's log look for:

- **Final training loss** — should be decreasing, not NaN
- **Metric validation during training** — if the recipe enabled periodic validation
- **Number of training steps** — confirms full training duration

## Step 5 — Produce validation report

```markdown
## Speculative Decoding Pipeline Validation Report

**Experiment:** <exp_dir>
**Model:** <model_name>
**Algorithm:** <algorithm>
**Date:** <date>
**Pipeline config:** <yaml_path>

### Task Status
| Task | Name | Status | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Data synthesis | PASS/FAIL/TIMEOUT | N samples generated |
| 1 | Hidden state dump | PASS/FAIL | N .pt files |
| 2 | Training + export | PASS/FAIL | Final loss: X.XX |
| 3 | Benchmark | PASS/FAIL | AR: X.XX |

### Quality Gate
- <metric>: X.XX (threshold: <threshold>) — PASS/FAIL

### Training Summary
- Final loss: X.XX
- Training steps: N
- Metric during training: X.XX (if validated)

### Overall: PASS / FAIL
<one-line summary>
```

Adjust the task rows to the tasks this config actually ran — task count varies by
algorithm and variant.

## Step 6 — Suggest next steps

**If PASS:**

- Record the verified result (and checkpoint path) in the team's internal triage
  tracker
- This model is now a candidate to add as a launcher example in a dedicated PR

**If FAIL:**

- Identify which task or metric failed
- Go to `triage.md` for diagnosis
- For a low acceptance rate, diagnose the specific cause from the run (training loss
  curve, data volume/quality, draft capacity, hyperparameters) and suggest fixes
  targeted to that scenario — a low rate can have many causes, so avoid a generic
  checklist.
