## NeMo Evaluator Launcher Assistant

Guide the user through creating NEL YAML configs, running evaluations, and monitoring progress.

### Workspace integration

If `MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT` is set, use the common skill's `workspace-management.md` and reuse existing workspaces (this skill is usually the final stage of PTQ → Deploy → Eval; carry any deployment-time patches into `deployment.command`).

### Workflow

```text
- [ ] Step 0: Check workspace (if MODELOPT_WORKSPACE_ROOT set)
- [ ] Step 1: Check `nel` install + existing config; set up `.env` (+ `modelopttools:eval-config` for judge-scored runs)
- [ ] Step 2: Build base config (5-question flow OR shortcut)
- [ ] Step 3: Configure deployment (model path, params, cross-check)
- [ ] Step 4: Fill remaining ??? values
- [ ] Step 5: Confirm tasks (iterative)
- [ ] Step 6: Multi-node (if needed)
- [ ] Step 7: Interceptors (if needed)
- [ ] Step 7.5: Container auth (SLURM private images)
- [ ] Step 8: Dry-run → canary → full run
- [ ] Step 9: Verify completed run
```

### nel-next path (Terminal-Bench 2.x, SWE-bench, …) — branch here FIRST

A few **agentic** AA benchmarks do **not** run on the currently validated
`nemo-evaluator-launcher` 0.2.6 path (Steps 1–9 don't apply). They run on **nel-next**
(`nemo-evaluator[harbor]` 0.4.x) — a separate package, CLI (`nel eval run`), `-O`
overrides, and `services`/`benchmarks`/`cluster`/`output` schema. If the user asks
for one, do **not** add it to a 0.2.6 `evaluation.tasks` list — instead:

1. Read **`references/nel-next.md`** (shared: venv, schema, AWS creds, architecture, timeout strategy, MLflow, run flow) + the per-benchmark recipe `recipes/tasks/aa_next/{terminal_bench_2_1,swebench_verified}.md`; start from `recipes/examples/example_eval_next.yaml`.
2. Isolated nel-next venv: `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/nel-next.sh" --setup-only` (keeps 0.2.6 `nel` untouched).
3. Run **`modelopttools:eval-config`** (Step 3b) to write the AWS-sandbox creds + harbor infra rows (`${NEL_NEXT_EVAL_IMAGE}`, `${HARBOR_*_ECR_REPOSITORY}`) into `.env`; always include the `output.export_config.mlflow` block.
4. Dry-run → canary → full (`nel-next.sh eval run`), then **push to MLflow** — SLURM doesn't auto-export, so run `nel-next.sh mlflow-push -r <run_id> -c <cfg>` after (config-driven; see `references/nel-next.md`).

Steps 1–9 below are currently validated with 0.2.6 — use them for everything else.

---

### GDPVal (NeMo Gym "Stirrup" agent) path — branch here too

GDPVal **does** run on the currently validated 0.2.6 `nel` launcher (as a
`nemo_gym` task, not nel-next), so Steps 1–9 apply — but it is mechanically
special and **standalone** (one gym eval per config; never mix it with `aa/`
tasks). If the user asks for GDPVal:

1. Read **`references/gym-gdpval.md`** (Apptainer SIF sandbox, gym prepare/reap
   machinery, deploy sizing, rubric-vs-comparison scoring, MLflow deliverables trap,
   failure modes) + **`recipes/tasks/gym/gdpval.md`**.
2. Start from **`recipes/examples/gym/example_gdpval.yaml`** — a single
   self-contained file.
3. Prerequisite — the Apptainer SIF. **If your site provides one, use it**
   (NVIDIA-internal: `modelopttools:eval-config` Step 3c); otherwise set
   `GDPVAL_SIF_DIR` in `.env` and build with `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/gdpval-sif.sh"`
   (build-if-absent, no cross-cluster copy). Either way the mounted dir must contain
   the file `GDPVAL_CONTAINER_PATH` names (template: `python-3.13.gdpval.sif`) — a
   name mismatch passes NEL's `test -d` check and the agent then silently runs
   unsandboxed. Verify with `gdpval-sif.sh --check`. `.env` needs `HF_TOKEN`, `INFERENCE_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`,
   `INFERENCE_JUDGE_URL`, `GDPVAL_SIF_DIR`, and `NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_PRE_CMD=1` (the
   config has a `pre_cmd`). Thinking mode is mandatory (non-thinking loses ~86%).
4. Run both dry-run and launch through `"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/nel-gdpval.sh"`; it
   enforces the currently validated 0.2.6 launcher even if `nel` on PATH is stale
   and avoids an unset `NEL_INVOCATION_ID` failure before client startup.
   **`limit_samples` is inert on the gym path** (the gym runs all 220 tasks
   regardless), so there is no cheap canary: watch the real run's first
   ~20–30 min for the SIF-sandbox line and judge auth, and cancel if wrong. See the
   recipe's Canary section.

---

### MRCR (NeMo Gym `simple_agent`) path — branch here too

A 0.2.6 `nemo_gym` task like GDPVal and equally **standalone**, but far simpler:
`simple_agent`, **no SIF, no judge, no Tavily** — deterministic prefix-gated
grading, `HF_TOKEN` the only secret. **Not an AA benchmark** — never generate it
for an "AA" request. If the user asks for MRCR:

1. Read **`recipes/tasks/gym/mrcr.md`**; start from
   **`recipes/examples/gym/example_mrcr.yaml`** (1M variant, like the golden).
2. **Pick the variant first** (`config_n3_1m` / `config_n3_128k` / `config`) — it
   sets the context cap, dataset *and* metric prefix; the three are not
   comparable; set it in **both** `data_prep_params` and `collect_rollout_params`.
3. `.env`: `HF_TOKEN` (dataset + n3 tokenizer are gated) plus
   `NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_PRE_CMD=1` (the `pre_cmd` installs `tiktoken` +
   `transformers`; prepare fails without it) and
   `NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_UNLISTED_TASKS=1` (`nemo_gym` is not in the FDF map).
4. **MRCR needs a git-backed Gym image.** The pin is newer than any image's baked
   Gym and must apply, so the template's `container:` is `???` and the bootstrap
   exits 1 on a non-git `/opt/Gym` (the public `eval-factory/nemo-gym:*` images).
   NVIDIA-internal: `modelopttools:eval-config` Step 3d names a working image.
5. Long-context deploy (`--max-model-len 1100000` +
   `VLLM_ALLOW_LONG_MAX_MODEL_LEN=1`, `gpu_memory_utilization: 0.95`,
   multi-instance fan-out); **never cap output tokens**; report the needle-count
   strata alongside `pass@1/accuracy`.

---

### Step 1 — Prerequisites

Run `nel --version`; if missing, instruct `pip install nemo-evaluator-launcher`. If user has an existing config, skip to Step 8 (optionally review for `???` and quantization flags first).

**Set up `.env` now (not Step 8).** The working `.env` lives at the **workspace root** — the directory you run `nel` from — matching `modelopttools:eval-config`'s convention; do **not** create it under the skill dir. (NEL does not discover `.env` by path: it reads secrets from the shell env via the `host:` prefix after you `source`, so the location is purely *which file you source* before `nel run`. Keeping the single `.env` at the workspace root avoids a stale duplicate under the symlinked, shared `.agents/` skill tree.) For judge-scored / user-sim tasks (HLE, AA-LCR, Tau2), seed it from the template if absent — the template ships under the skill dir, the working `.env` does not: `[ -f .env ] || cp "$SKILL_DIR/recipes/env.example" .env`. Then try `modelopttools:eval-config` (if available) to fill the judge `model_id`/`url` rows (user adds the secret key). Needed before Step 5, which substitutes those values into task `<VAR>` placeholders.

**Secret safety — never open `.env` with Read/Write/Edit.** The harness mirrors later edits of any agent-opened file into the transcript, so touching `.env` leaks the keys the user adds afterward. Use shell only (`cp` to create, `source` to load — neither echoes); edit `env.example`, never `.env`; leave value entry to the user / `modelopttools:eval-config`.

**Task recipes** (always read before editing the relevant task in the config):

- AA Index v2 suite (default for quantized-checkpoint validation, see `references/quantization-benchmarks.md`): `recipes/tasks/aa/{gpqa_diamond,hle,lcr,scicode,ifbench,mmmu_pro,tau2_bench_telecom,omniscience}.md`
- Optional: `recipes/tasks/mmlu_pro.md`, `recipes/tasks/aime_2025.md`, `recipes/tasks/livecodebench.md`
- **nel-next only** (different evaluator — see the nel-next section below, NOT the 0.2.6 steps): shared reference `references/nel-next.md` + per-benchmark recipes `recipes/tasks/aa_next/{terminal_bench_2_1,swebench_verified}.md` (agentic). The `aa_next/` dir holds tasks that require `nemo-evaluator[harbor]` 0.4.x (the package; `nemo-evaluator-next` is the eval *image* repo); `aa/` is the 0.2.6 suite.
- **NeMo Gym tasks** — `recipes/tasks/gym/*.md`, with self-contained examples at `recipes/examples/gym/example_<task>.yaml`. The `gym/` dir groups by **harness** (0.2.6 `nemo_gym`), **not** by suite membership, so read AA membership per task from the table below — never from the path. Every gym task is **standalone**: generated as its own config from its example, one gym eval per config, **never merged into the `aa/` multi-task `tasks` list** and never mixed with each other.

  | Task | Recipe / example | In AA suite? | Generate when |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | **GDPVal** (Stirrup agent, agentic) | `recipes/tasks/gym/gdpval.md` + `references/gym-gdpval.md`, `recipes/examples/gym/example_gdpval.yaml` | **Yes** | any AA request (see the AA rule below) |
  | **MRCR** (simple agent, long-context) | `recipes/tasks/gym/mrcr.md`, `recipes/examples/gym/example_mrcr.yaml` | **No** | only when the user asks for MRCR by name, or for long-context coverage |

**AA rule:** If the user mentions "AA" / "Artificial Analysis", generate the `recipes/tasks/aa/` tasks (one multi-task config) **plus a companion standalone GDPVal config** (`recipes/tasks/gym/gdpval.md`, via the GDPVal branch) — GDPVal is part of the AA suite but a different harness, so it's its own config, never added to the `aa/` `tasks` list. Do not add MMLU-Pro, AIME 2025, or LiveCodeBench unless explicitly asked. GDPVal is the heaviest AA task (standalone, multi-hour, needs the SIF sandbox + judge) — surface it and let the user opt out per run.

**Shortcut path** (when task list is known up front, e.g. "run AA"):

1. Read the task reference file(s).
2. Use `recipes/examples/example_eval.yaml` as the base.
3. Copy the YAML fragment(s) into `evaluation.tasks`, applying any per-task notes.
4. **MLflow auto-export is on by default** — it needs **two** pieces, both in `example_eval.yaml`: (a) the **trigger** `execution.auto_export.destinations: [mlflow]` (without it the run is *not* uploaded), and (b) the `export.mlflow` block that configures it. In the `export.mlflow` block use **literal** values for `experiment_name` / `description` / `tags` — substitute the actual `served_model_name` and sampling params. Do **not** use `${deployment.*}` / `${evaluation.*}` cross-references: with auto-export on, NEL resolves the export block at submit time in a scope without those nodes and fails with `Interpolation key '...' not found` (`${oc.env:USER}` and `${oc.env:MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}` are fine — they're env vars). Because these literals can't interpolate, keep the `temperature` / `top_p` / `max_new_tokens` tags **equal to** the top-level `params` and update both in the same edit — they're the only queryable record of sampling in MLflow (NEL doesn't log them as run params), so a stale tag silently misreports the run. `tracking_uri` = `${oc.env:MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}` from `modelopttools:eval-config` (not hand-filled), and auto-export needs `execution.cpu_partition` (e.g. gcp-nrt `cpu`) — it's a separate CPU-only sbatch that GPU-only partitions reject (`Cannot find GPU specification`), silently dropping the link.
5. Proceed to Step 3, then Step 4, then Step 7.5/8. Skip Step 2's 5-question flow.

---

### Step 2 — Build base config (when not using shortcut)

Ask the 5 questions via AskUserQuestion (categories must match `nel skills build-config --help` — **run that first** to confirm the current option names; CLI options override this list).

1. **Execution:** Local / SLURM
2. **Deployment:** None (External) / vLLM / SGLang / NIM / TRT-LLM. Prefer vLLM unless the user/card says otherwise.
3. **Auto-export:** None / MLflow / wandb
4. **Model type:** Base / Chat / Reasoning
5. **Benchmarks** (multi-select): standard / code / math_reasoning / safety / multilingual

Build the base:

```bash
nel skills build-config --execution <...> --deployment <...> --model_type <...> --benchmarks <...> [--export <...>] [--output <...>]
```

(`--output` omitted = cwd auto-named; directory = dir + auto-name; `*.yaml` = exact path. Never overwrites.)

---

### Step 3 — Configure deployment

**Model path.** Checkpoint path (`/`, `./`, `../`, `~`, or exists on disk) → set `deployment.checkpoint_path`, leave `hf_model_handle: null`. Else HF handle (one `/`, not on disk) → set `deployment.hf_model_handle`, leave `checkpoint_path: null`.

> **Prefer `checkpoint_path` over `hf_model_handle` on SLURM** — `hf_model_handle` isn't reliably mounted at `/checkpoint`, so the deploy dies with `HFValidationError`. To eval an un-staged HF model, stage it first (`huggingface_hub.snapshot_download`) and point `checkpoint_path` at it. See `example_eval.yaml` for why.

**Auto-detect ModelOpt quantization** (checkpoint paths). Check `config.json` for `quantization_config` (or legacy `hf_quant_config.json`):

- **vLLM:** no `--quantization` flag by default — vLLM auto-detects from `quantization_config` / `hf_quant_config.json`. Add only when the card, vLLM version, or dry-run error requires it.
- **SGLang:** may need `--quantization modelopt_fp8` / `modelopt_fp4` / `modelopt` — verify against installed version.

Some models need extra vLLM backend env vars (model-card research) — e.g. `VLLM_NVFP4_GEMM_BACKEND=marlin` (Nemotron Super), or `VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4=1` + `VLLM_FLASHINFER_MOE_BACKEND=throughput` (NVFP4 MoE, e.g. NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-NVFP4). Put them in `deployment.env_vars` (**not** `command`) with the `lit:` prefix (`VLLM_USE_FLASHINFER_MOE_FP4: lit:1`); see `example_eval.yaml` and Step 5's prefix rule.

**Auto-detect from `config.json`:**

| Field | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| `max_position_embeddings` | `--max-model-len <value>` |
| `auto_map` exists | `--trust-remote-code` |

#### Cross-check both sources for vLLM (mandatory, neither replaces the other)

**Source 1 — `recipes.vllm.ai/<org>/<model>`** (curated vLLM recipes; authoritative for parallelism, family-specific flags like `--reasoning-parser` / `--tool-call-parser` / `--mm-encoder-tp-mode`, vLLM version, spec-decoding, GPU count). **Fetch the page for the EXACT model id, not a base/sibling** — variant minimums differ (e.g. MiniMax-M2 ≥0.11.0 vs M2.7 ≥0.20.0). Pin variants via query params (e.g. `?variant=fp8&strategy=single_node_tep`).

> **WebFetch caveat — triage the summary:**
>
> 1. **"No `vllm serve` commands found" / "page is a usage guide":** JS-rendering miss. recipes.vllm.ai pages always have ≥1 command. Ask the user to paste it or share the variant URL.
> 2. **Single recipe returned** for a model with known multiple variants → retry with variant-pinned URL. Axis names differ per model (Qwen: `?variant=&strategy=`; Kimi: `?advanced=`; others vary — no fixed pattern).
> 3. **Variant label contradicts the command** (e.g. label "TEP" but command shows DP+EP) → summarizer conflated variants; ask user.
>
> For non-trivial deployments (≥120B, multi-node, novel arch), ask the user which variant *before* fetching.

**Source 2 — HF model card + `config.json`** (authoritative for):

| Signal | Flag |
| --- | --- |
| `max_position_embeddings` | `--max-model-len <value>` |
| `auto_map` | `--trust-remote-code` |
| Reasoning/CoT documented | `--reasoning-parser` (and `--reasoning-parser-plugin` if custom) |
| Tool-calling documented | `--enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser <parser>` |
| Custom flags in card | Add as specified (e.g. `--mamba_ssm_cache_dtype float32`) |

**Cross-check rules:**

1. Read both sources before composing the command.
2. Agree → use with confidence.
3. Disagree → **do not silently pick one.** Surface both values to the user. Common conflicts: stale cards, parser rename between generations (Qwen2.5 `hermes` → Qwen3 `qwen3_coder`), recipe-only flags like `--language-model-only`, ARM64-specific card notes.
4. Resolve in Step 3 — don't defer to dry-run.

#### vLLM deployment command structure — single `command:` field

Rewrite the build-config output into one `command:` field. Move all parallelism (`--tensor-parallel-size`, `--data-parallel-size`, `--pipeline-parallel-size`) into the command; do not keep separate `tensor_parallel_size` / `data_parallel_size` / `extra_args` YAML fields.

```yaml
deployment:
  command: >-
    vllm serve /checkpoint
    --host 0.0.0.0
    --port ${deployment.port}
    --tensor-parallel-size <N>
    --data-parallel-size <M>
    --max-model-len <value>
    <... rest of cross-checked flags ...>
```

Conventions: always start `vllm serve /checkpoint` (NEL mounts here); always `--served-model-name ${deployment.served_model_name}` (**required**; see `example_eval.yaml` for why); always `--host 0.0.0.0 --port ${deployment.port}`; use folded scalar (`>-`) for one flag per line. Example fallback `--max-model-len 131072` covers AA-LCR (~120K + 16K gen) and SciCode (≥ 65536) — prefer `config.json` / recipe value.

For how to choose `--tensor-parallel-size` / `--data-parallel-size` / `--pipeline-parallel-size` (and EP) from the model size and your GPU count, read `references/parallelism.md` — cross-check the layout against `recipes.vllm.ai`, then adapt to the GPUs you actually have via the fit math there.

**Image / vLLM version.** Treat default `image: vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0` as a floor to verify: bump to the **exact model's** `recipes.vllm.ai` minimum if higher. Running below minimum is a trap — the server starts, then a worker dies mid-inference with `CUDA error: an illegal memory access`, easy to misread as a kernel bug. A model newer than the latest release may have no numbered tag — use the image its recipe names. Never `:latest` (breaks reproducibility). Surface version bumps to the user.

> **NVFP4 on Blackwell B300/GB300 (sm_103) needs a CUDA-13 build** — the cu12 build has no sm_103 FP4 kernel, so engine init dies with `CUDA error: no kernel image is available`. **Pick the tag by the CUDA version it reports, not by its name — vLLM inverted its tag convention at v0.20.0:**
>
> | vLLM version | CUDA-13 tag | CUDA-12 tag |
> | --- | --- | --- |
> | ≤ v0.19.x | **suffixed** `-cu130` | unsuffixed |
> | ≥ v0.20.0 | **unsuffixed** | suffixed `-cu129` |
>
> v0.20.0 ships both suffixes; after it `-cu130` doesn't exist, so asking for it yields a missing tag. **Select a tag whose config blob reports `CUDA_VERSION` ≥ 13** (registry API), reading the child manifest for **the platform you deploy on** (arm64 Grace/GB300, amd64 x86) — `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` differs per platform, so check your arch against that child. Multimodal on sm_103 may also need `--mm-encoder-attn-backend TRITON_ATTN`. Full note in `recipes/examples/example_eval.yaml`.

#### vLLM-backend defaults — always include unless the recipe *contradicts*

Silence is not contradiction. Drop/override only when the recipe sets a different value for the same setting (e.g. recipe pins `--max-num-batched-tokens 16384` → use 16384).

- `--model-loader-extra-config '{"enable_multithread_load": true, "num_threads": 128}'` — **parallelizes checkpoint load**, the single biggest deploy-time cost for large checkpoints. A big MoE otherwise loads shards ~sequentially (~1 min/shard → e.g. ~40 min for a ~450 GB / 45-shard checkpoint); on a **preemptible** queue that long load window is exactly where jobs get killed before they ever serve. `num_threads` defaults to **128**; scale it to the checkpoint (smaller for small models, bounded by the shared-FS read bandwidth — too high yields no gain). Safe to always include.
- `--max-num-batched-tokens 8192` — caps per-step batched tokens; prevents long-prefill stalls.
- `--enable-chunked-prefill` — interleaves long prefills with decode steps (required for AA-LCR's ~120K input). Modern vLLM defaults this on for many models; set explicitly to avoid drift.
- `--enable-expert-parallel` — **MoE-only default.** Detect MoE from handle suffix (`-A10B`, `-A3B`, etc.), `num_experts` / `num_local_experts` / `n_routed_experts` in `config.json`, or card. No-op when TP=DP=1, safe to always include for MoE. Do not add for dense models. See `references/parallelism.md` for what EP does and the DP-attention + EP-MoE throughput pattern.
- `--max-num-seqs N` — **omit at generation time** (top-level `parallelism` is `???`). Add this comment above `command:`:

  ```text
  # After filling in `parallelism` values (top-level + per-task overrides),
  # append `--max-num-seqs N` where N = ceil(max_parallelism / data_parallel_size).
  ```

  In Step 4 compute and append. Example: top-level=16, Tau2=128, DP=8 → `ceil(128/8)=16`. Too small → request queuing; too large → wasted KV reservation. For how to choose the `parallelism` it derives from, read `references/parallelism.md`.

#### Evaluation params template (top-level params)

The top-level `nemo_evaluator_config.config.params` must contain **exactly these six fields** — no `top_k` / `presence_penalty` / `repetition_penalty` / `min_p`:

```yaml
nemo_evaluator_config:
  config:
    params:
      parallelism: ???    # Required — size per references/parallelism.md (bounded by total request count vs GPU serving capacity); ask user in Step 4 if still unclear
      request_timeout: 3600
      max_retries: 10
      max_new_tokens: 65536  # see rule below
      temperature: 1.0    # from model card (reasoning); adjust
      top_p: 0.95         # from model card (reasoning); adjust
```

Per-task `max_new_tokens` overrides are forbidden — set one top-level ceiling everywhere.

**Cross-check `temperature` / `top_p` / `max_new_tokens` against `references/nvfp4-modelcard-sampling.md`** — the published settings for the 2026 NVFP4 checkpoints under `huggingface.co/nvidia` that disclose them (older releases and cards that publish nothing are absent — for those, read the card; `-DSpark` / `-DFlash` spec-decode variants share their base checkpoint's row, since spec decoding does not change the target's output distribution). **The card is the source of truth; this file is a reference, not a constraint** — use it to confirm a value you read, to fill a gap when the card is silent or ambiguous, and to catch a misreading. Worth consulting whenever the model is an NVFP4 checkpoint **or shares a family with one** (Qwen3.x, GLM-4.7/5.x, Kimi K2.x/K3, MiniMax M2.x/M3, DeepSeek V3.x/V4/R1, Gemma 4, Nemotron 3/3.5, Llama-Nemotron, Mistral Medium 3.5), and especially when you are unsure. It is a dated snapshot, so for anything newer than it, trust the card. See that file's "Lookup" section.

#### `max_new_tokens` — mandatory model-card lookup

1. **Fetch the HF model card before writing the value.** Not optional.
2. Scan for any `max_tokens` / `max_new_tokens` / "output length" recommendation. Pick the **highest** value the card mentions (Qwen3.6: 32768 general + 81920 math-coding → use **81920**). Annotate with a citing comment.
3. **Consult `references/nvfp4-modelcard-sampling.md` as a reference.** Listed and in agreement → proceed with confidence. Listed and different → **the card wins**; re-read it, then note the discrepancy for the user rather than auto-correcting either way. Not listed, or the card is silent or ambiguous → take the nearest same-family rows as the value, a far better prior than the generic fallback below. Its `max_num_tokens` column records the card's *headline* cap, so rule 2 above still governs: when a card names more than one cap, the highest wins even if that exceeds the row.
4. If the card is genuinely silent after a thorough read **and** the family table offers no usable pattern, fall back to: **65536** (reasoning), **16384** (non-reasoning); surface the silence to the user.
5. **Forbidden:** writing `max_new_tokens: <generic_default>` with a "card not yet checked" comment. Either fetch and apply, or fetch and confirm silence.
6. **A higher cap doesn't fix runaway reasoning.** On hard tasks (e.g. HLE) a non-terminating model just rambles to the larger cap (~80% length-capped at 131072), and the cap only helps if deployment `--max-model-len > prompt + max_new_tokens` (else generation is silently clipped — AA-LCR's ~120K input leaves little room). Treat such tasks as low-confidence.

#### Quantization-aware benchmark defaults

For quantized checkpoints, read `references/quantization-benchmarks.md` for sensitivity rankings and recommended sets; present and ask which to include. Read `references/model-card-research.md` for the full extraction checklist (sampling, reasoning config, ARM64, `pre_cmd`, output length — see the dedicated bullet there).

Reasoning models: prefer reasoning mode (highest scores). For lower variance / cost / apples-to-apples vs non-reasoning baselines, also consider a non-reasoning companion run.

#### Reasoning adapter config (`use_reasoning`)

The `adapter_config` block in `example_eval.yaml` controls request/response
logging and reasoning handling. `use_reasoning: true` strips the model's
reasoning/CoT trace before scoring (grade only the final answer). Set per type:

1. **Instruct → `use_reasoning: false`** and drop the `chat_template_kwargs`
   thinking block (no trace to strip; can mangle plain responses).
2. **Reasoning → `use_reasoning: true`**, especially when the deployment sets
   `--reasoning-parser` (vLLM emits a separate reasoning channel to strip).
3. **Hybrid (reasoning on *or* off) → turn it ON** (`use_reasoning: true` +
   force the thinking flag in `chat_template_kwargs`). For the exact toggle key
   (it drifts across generations) and the reasoning-effort policy, see
   `references/model-card-research.md` → "Reasoning config".

### Step 4 — Fill remaining ??? values

**Predefined per-cluster execution config (check FIRST).** Some installs ship `internal/slurm/<cluster>` execution groups (optional `nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal` pkg) that pre-fill hostname/partition/gres — leaving only account/output_dir/walltime. Discover at runtime (nothing cluster-specific hardcoded):

```bash
python3 -c 'import nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal' 2>/dev/null && \
PKG=$(python3 -c 'import nemo_evaluator_launcher_internal as m,os;print(os.path.dirname(m.__file__))') && \
for f in "$PKG"/configs/execution/internal/slurm/*.yaml; do \
  echo "$(basename "$f" .yaml) -> $(grep -E '^hostname:' "$f" | awk '{print $2}')"; done
```

Hostname match → set `defaults: - execution: internal/slurm/<cluster>`, drop the redundant `execution.hostname` (keep account/output_dir/walltime), verify with `--dry-run`. Else keep `slurm/default` and fill hostname/account/output_dir manually.

On SLURM, several deploy/eval failures are invisible to `--dry-run` and only surface at canary (`mount_home`, HF cache, `cpu_partition`, top-level vs per-stage `env_vars`) — read `references/slurm.md`.

- Find every `???` left. Ask the user only for what can't be inferred (SLURM hostname/account/output_dir, the `cpu_partition` for auto-export, etc.). Don't propose defaults; let them give plain text. (`tracking_uri` is **not** one of these — it's `${oc.env:MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI}` from `modelopttools:eval-config`.)
- **`parallelism`** — size it yourself from the run shape (total requests = `dataset_size × repeats` vs GPU serving capacity), and set `--max-num-seqs` to match. Read `references/parallelism.md` for the decision rule and worked examples; only ask the user if a non-GPU cap (e.g. judge rate limit) is unknown.
- Ask about other defaults they may want to change (partition, walltime, MLflow tags).
- **`execution.gres`** — auto-set if you used a predefined `internal/slurm/<cluster>` config (above). On the `slurm/default` fallback it's `gpu:8`, so set it to the node's GPU count (and match `--data-parallel-size`/`--tensor-parallel-size`) or `sbatch` rejects the job with *"Requested node configuration is not available"* (e.g. 4-GPU GB300 → `gres: gpu:4`; check with `sinfo -o '%P %G'`).

**Walltime cap: 4 hours.** Always `execution.walltime: "04:00:00"`. The cluster does not schedule jobs longer than 4h — this is a hard limit, not a preference.

Evals that exceed 4h of wall-clock time are handled by **NEL's built-in dependency-chain resume**, not by shrinking the eval. NEL submits the first SLURM job; if it hits walltime, a dependent follow-on job resumes from the response/result caches the first job wrote, then queues another follow-on. Long evals continue across walltime windows automatically. See `references/run-validation.md#nel-timeout-and-resume-behavior` for the full mechanism.

**Preemption / external kill — resume manually with `sbatch run.sub`.** On a preemptible account (common on busy internal clusters) the scheduler can **CANCEL** a run mid-eval for a higher-priority job — `sacct -j <id>` shows `CANCELLED by <uid>` (a `svc-*` service account) with `Elapsed` well under the 4h walltime. NEL does **not** auto-resume this (its dependency chain only fires on a genuine walltime timeout). But the `run.sub` that NEL generated for the job (in its run dir) is **re-submittable** and resumes from the same `output_dir` + response cache (`skip_filled`), continuing from the partial output rather than restarting:

```bash
ssh <host> "cd <output_dir>/<timestamp>-<invocation>/<task>/ && sbatch run.sub"
```

Re-submit again if it's preempted again — each resume re-deploys, then skips already-generated samples, so progress is **cumulative** across attempts until it completes. Always confirm via `sacct -j <id>` that the prior job was `CANCELLED` (not a real failure) before resuming.

Implications for the agent:

- Do **not** lower `num_repeats`, split heavy tasks (AA-LCR, SciCode) into separate configs, or otherwise carve up the eval to fit inside 4h. Let NEL chain.
- Do **not** treat a walltime timeout as a failed run. Check `nel status` / `nel info` and the dependent job's logs before declaring failure. `references/run-validation.md` covers what a real failure looks like vs an expected resume event.
- Bumping `data_parallel_size` / `parallelism` to finish faster is fine when the goal is wall-clock latency, not a walltime workaround — but it's optional, not required, for runs longer than 4h.

### Step 5 — Confirm tasks (iterative)

1. Tell user: "Run `nel ls tasks` for the full task list."
2. For any task with a `recipes/tasks/` reference, read it and prefer its YAML fragment + repeat counts.
3. Ask about add/remove/modify. Per-task overrides under task's `nemo_evaluator_config.config.params`:

   ```yaml
   tasks:
     - name: <task>
       nemo_evaluator_config:
         config:
           params:
             temperature: <value>
             ...
   ```

4. Apply, show updated list, ask "Final, or more changes?" Loop until confirmed.

**Tasks that call an external judge / user-simulator / scoring endpoint.** Treat this as a general pattern, not a fixed list — HLE, AA-LCR, and Tau2 need one today, but other benchmarks may too (check each task's recipe). Their `model_id` / `url` are **config, not secrets**: substitute the **literal** values the user keeps in `.env` (keys per the task's recipe + `recipes/env.example`) into the task's `<VAR>` placeholders. Do **not** emit `${oc.env:...}` for these (it silently fails unless the var was exported with `set -a`). Only `api_key` stays an env-var *name* (e.g. `INFERENCE_API_KEY`), exported and read by the harness. All judges + user-sims (HLE, AA-LCR, Tau2, AIME) use one `INFERENCE_API_KEY` against one OpenAI-compatible host (AIME's simple-evals default judge endpoint is overridden to it — see its recipe). Get the `*_MODEL_ID`/`*_URL` values via `modelopttools:eval-config` (see Step 1) rather than guessing a host; only fill them by hand if it's unavailable. `.env` should already exist (Step 1) — if not, set it up now (don't defer to Step 8) before substituting.

**Known issue — nemo-skills self-deployment:** If using `nemo_skills.*` tasks (`ns_*`) with self-deployment (vLLM/SGLang/NIM), you need **both** of these:

```yaml
evaluation:
  env_vars:
    DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy   # MUST be set here — see below
  nemo_evaluator_config:
    target:
      api_endpoint:
        api_key_name: DUMMY_API_KEY
```

`api_key_name` only names the env var; the nemo-skills client **hard-fails if that var has no value inside the eval container** (`ValueError: api_key_env_var=DUMMY_API_KEY but the value is not set`). On SLURM, a shell `export DUMMY_API_KEY=dummy` (Step 8) does **NOT** propagate into the container — NEL only injects vars declared in `env_vars`. So declare `DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy` under `evaluation.env_vars` (note the `lit:` prefix — see below). The shell export only helps for local/Docker runs. External-deployment configs already define `api_key_name`.

**NEL env-var value prefixes (required):** every value in an `env_vars` map needs an explicit prefix — `host:VAR` (read from the submitting shell's env at submit time), `lit:value` (literal string), or `runtime:VAR` (read in the job at run time). A bare value (e.g. `DUMMY_API_KEY: dummy`) hard-errors: *"Env var value '…' must have an explicit prefix."* Use `lit:` for constants like `DUMMY_API_KEY` and `VLLM_*` backend selectors, `host:` for secrets like `HF_TOKEN` / `INFERENCE_API_KEY`.

---

### Step 6 — Multi-node

For models > ~120B or higher throughput needs, read `references/multi-node.md` for HAProxy multi-instance / Ray TP/PP / combined patterns.

### Step 7 — Interceptors

Direct user to <https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/evaluator/latest/libraries/nemo-evaluator/interceptors/index.html>. Do not provide generic interceptor info — read the specific interceptor's page if asked, then configure via `evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.target.api_endpoint.adapter_config` (`target` is a sibling of `config`, not nested under it). Use the per-field syntax from the CLI Configuration section, not a full `interceptors:` list (that overrides the default chain).

**Errata:** Logging field names are `max_logged_requests` / `max_logged_responses` (NOT `max_saved_*` / `max_*` as some docs show).

### Step 7.5 — Container registry auth (SLURM private images only)

Default images:

| Framework | Image | Registry |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vLLM | `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.26.0` (bump per recipe; never `:latest`) | DockerHub |
| vLLM (NVFP4 on B300/GB300) | default is already **CUDA-13**; for older pins see Step 3 | DockerHub |
| SGLang | `lmsysorg/sglang:latest` | DockerHub |
| TRT-LLM | `nvcr.io/nvidia/tensorrt-llm/release:...` | NGC |
| Eval tasks | `nvcr.io/nvidia/eval-factory/*:26.03` | NGC |

> NVFP4 checkpoints on B300/GB300 (sm_103) need a **CUDA-13** image — CUDA-12 builds lack sm_103 FP4 kernels. The tag spelling depends on the vLLM version (Step 3 table); verify `CUDA_VERSION` in your platform's child manifest.

Public images → submit without preflight. Private/restricted → check credentials:

```bash
ssh <host> "grep -E '^\s*machine\s+' ~/.config/enroot/.credentials 2>/dev/null"
```

Add credentials per the common skill's `slurm-setup.md` §6 if missing. If you can't add, switch to a compatible public image (e.g. `nvcr.io/nvidia/vllm:<YY.MM>-py3` — check catalog.ngc.nvidia.com). **Do not retry more than once** after an auth failure.

---

### Step 8 — Run evaluation (gated dry-run → canary → full)

Run directly when the user asked to launch; otherwise ask before submitting.

**Env setup:** `.env` is normally already created and filled back in Step 1 (via `modelopttools:eval-config`), at the **workspace root** — the dir you run `nel` from, not under the skill dir. Ensure it exists and source it — do **not** clobber an existing `.env`:

```bash
# .env lives at the workspace root (where you run nel); the template ships under the skill dir
[ -f .env ] || cp "$SKILL_DIR/recipes/env.example" .env   # create only if Step 1 didn't
set -a && source .env && set +a

# If pre_cmd/post_cmd in config (review pre_cmd first — runs arbitrary commands):
export NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_PRE_CMD=1
# If nemo_skills.* + self-deployment, for LOCAL/Docker runs only:
export DUMMY_API_KEY=dummy
# On SLURM this shell export does NOT reach the container — instead declare
# `DUMMY_API_KEY: lit:dummy` under evaluation.env_vars (see Step 5).
```

**Step 8.1 — Dry-run** (config validation):

```bash
nel run --config <path> --dry-run
```

Fix unresolved `???`, bad Hydra overrides, missing env vars, invalid mounts, image issues, sbatch errors, obvious deployment errors before proceeding.

> **Dry-run does NOT validate the image/vLLM version** (image pulled only at deploy). Confirm `image:` ≥ the exact model's `recipes.vllm.ai` minimum (Step 3) before submitting — too-old passes dry-run, then crashes mid-inference.

> **Non-fatal noise:** "Failed to get manifest"/`401`/`404`, "Could not extract frame definition file", "proceeding with minimal task definition", "Found N unlisted task(s)" — expected for `ns_*`/recipe tasks and private (gitlab) containers; the task still runs in-container. Set `NEMO_EVALUATOR_TRUST_UNLISTED_TASKS=1`. Real blockers: unresolved `???`, interpolation errors, bad mounts, sbatch rejections.

**Step 8.2 — Canary** (limited-samples, validates everything dry-run can't):

```bash
nel run --config <path> -o ++evaluation.nemo_evaluator_config.config.params.limit_samples=10
```

Catches judge auth/rate-limits, container failures, sandbox issues, OOM, bad request formatting, low evaluated counts. Always inspect logs:

```bash
nel status <id>
nel info <id> --logs
ssh <user>@<host> "grep -i 'traceback\|exception\|error\|failed\|oom\|killed\|timeout\|unauthorized\|rate limit\|sandbox\|container\|judge\|parse\|scoring' <log_path>/*.log"
```

Canary each risky task class separately (judge-scored, code-execution, model-only). Start `parallelism` conservatively; raise only after judge/sandbox logs are clean — they bottleneck before the model. For capacity-bound runs, tune `parallelism`/`--max-num-seqs` here against vLLM's reported max concurrency + preemption — see `references/parallelism.md`.

Single-task rerun: `nel run --config <path> -t <task_name>` (combine with `-o ++...limit_samples=10` for canary).

**Step 8.3 — Full run** (after canary passes):

```bash
nel run --config <path>
```

Remove `limit_samples` overrides; keep canary-validated parallelism. If the canary fails, fix and rerun the canary — don't skip to full.

**Monitoring:** Register the job per the **monitor** skill for cross-session tracking. One-off live status / debugging → **launching-evals** skill. Past-run MLflow queries → **accessing-mlflow** skill. NEL timeout/resume → read `references/run-validation.md` before treating the run as failed.

---

### Step 9 — Verify completed run

Before pulling/reporting scores, validate the run. Read `references/run-validation.md` for NEL timeout/resume behavior, completed-run validation, diagnostics, and score harvesting. For a baseline that will be compared with a candidate, also perform its **External Baseline Sanity Check** before a success verdict, then hand the validated runs to `compare-results` for baseline-vs-candidate deltas.
